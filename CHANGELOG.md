## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **GPU Acceleration Support** - PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support for 5-10x faster transcription on NVIDIA GPUs.
  - Automatic GPU detection with graceful fallback to CPU
  - Supports float16 precision on GPU for optimal performance
  - Works with all modern NVIDIA GPUs (GTX 10 series+, Quadro, RTX)
  - Added `GPU_QUICKSTART.md` and `GPU_SETUP.md` documentation
  - Added `verify_gpu.bat` verification script
  - Active device/precision shown in Settings → Transcription status chip
  - Example: 18s audio transcribes in ~2-4s (GPU) vs 9-13s (CPU)
- **Conversation Memory System** - Implemented a robust SQLite database for storing and managing transcription history, replacing the previous JSON-based system.
  - Created a `DatabaseManager` to handle all database operations.
  - Integrated the `DatabaseManager` into the `HistoryPage` for all data operations.
  - Added full-text search capabilities to the `DatabaseManager` and integrated them into the `HistoryPage`.
- **Plugin System Foundation** - Established a dynamic plugin loading system to support community-developed extensions.
  - Created a `plugin_loader` to discover and load plugins from designated directories.
  - Integrated the plugin loader into the `PluginRegistry` for seamless registration.
- **Plugin Management Page** - Added a new page to the UI for viewing and managing plugins.
- **Value Metrics Dashboard** - Created a new dashboard page to visualize the time and cost savings generated by Scribe.
- **Build Timestamp System** - Added build timestamp tracking to enable intelligent version checking and auto-upgrades.
  - `BUILD_TIMESTAMP` field in `__version__.py` tracks when each build was created
  - Auto-upgrade system compares both version numbers and build timestamps
  - Newer versions/builds automatically close older running instances
  - Downgrade protection prevents accidentally starting older versions/builds
  - Clear user messaging shows which version/build is running and why upgrade/downgrade failed
  - New tool: `tools/update_build_timestamp.py` to update timestamps before releases
  - New test suite: `tools/test_version_checking.py` to validate upgrade scenarios
  - Documentation: `docs/BUILD_TIMESTAMP.md` and `tools/README.md`
- New settings window to configure WhisperWriter.
- New main window to either start the keyboard listener or open the settings window.
- New continuous recording mode ([Issue #40](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/40)).
- New option to play a sound when transcription finishes ([Issue #40](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/40)).

### Changed
- Migrated status window from using `tkinter` to `PyQt5`.
- Migrated from using JSON to using YAML to store configuration settings.
- Upgraded to latest versions of `openai` and `faster-whisper`, including support for local API ([Issue #32](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/32)).

### Fixed
- Transcription engine now correctly uses the language selected in the settings, rather than defaulting to English.
- Corrected missing methods in the `HistoryPage` class, resolving test failures.
- Resolved test runner failures caused by module import and Unicode encoding errors.
- Fixed a `ValueError` in the microphone test function that caused a crash when analyzing audio.
- Fixed a `TypeError` in the home page that occurred when formatting timestamps from the database.
- Resolved a UI redraw issue on the home page by removing the legacy `HomePage`.
- Fixed a `UnicodeEncodeError` that caused transcription to fail when printing non-ASCII characters to the console.
- Fixed an issue where "No speech detected" was erroneously reported by ensuring that audio data is correctly passed to the transcription engine.

### Removed
- Removed the SCF caching section from the settings UI, as it is a development-only feature.
- No longer using `keyboard` package to listen for key presses.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-01-28
### Added
- New message to identify whether Whisper was being called using the API or running locally.
- Additional hold-to-talk ([PR #28](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/28)) and press-to-toggle recording methods ([Issue #21](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/21)).
- New configuration options to:
  - Choose recording method (defaulting to voice activity detection).
  - Choose which sound device and sample rate to use.
  - Hide the status window ([PR #28](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/28)).

### Changed
- Migrated from `whisper` to `faster-whisper` ([Issue #11](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/issues/11)).
- Migrated from `pyautogui` to `pynput` ([PR #10](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/10)).
- Migrated from `webrtcvad` to `webrtcvad-wheels` ([PR #17](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/17)).
- Changed default activation key combo from `ctrl+alt+space` to `ctrl+shift+space`.
- Changed to using a local model rather than the API by default.
- Revamped README.md, including new Roadmap, Contributing, and Credits sections.

### Fixed
- Local model is now only loaded once at start-up, rather than every time the activation key combo was pressed.
- Default configuration now auto-chooses compute type for the local model to avoid warnings.
- Graceful degradation to CPU if CUDA isn't available ([PR #30](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/30)).
- Removed long prefix of spaces in transcription ([PR #19](https://github.com/savbell/whisper-writer/pull/19)).

## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-29
### Added
- Initial release of WhisperWriter.
- Added CHANGELOG.md.
- Added Versioning and Known Issues to README.md.

### Changed
- Updated Whisper Python package; the local model is now compatible with Python 3.11.
